# NLP-Hate_Speech_Classification
This repository contains code, models, and resources for building and evaluating a NLP model focused on [specific task, e.g., hate speech classification]. The model leverages advanced NLP techniques, including word embeddings, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Transformer models like BERT, to accurately analyze and classify text data.
